This is a file just added through a pull request to test the CLA verification.

Will changing this add a commit to the pull request?

It seems it will actually do that! So here is another update!

This time we added a forward of the GITHUB_TOKEN, we'll see if that automatically works or not.

Broke the chain, will have to try again.

Reservered name, try to simply forward the token, then we will figure out how to use it.

Added a reference, we'll see if the rest calls uses it automatically or not.
