This is a file just added through a pull request to test the CLA verification.

Will changing this add a commit to the pull request?

It seems it will actually do that! So here is another update!

This time we added a forward of the GITHUB_TOKEN, we'll see if that automatically works or not.

Broke the chain, will have to try again.

Reservered name, try to simply forward the token, then we will figure out how to use it.

Added a reference, we'll see if the rest calls uses it automatically or not.

Fix stupid mistake.

Try AI change for secret location.

Try more permissions.

Moving stuff to env after reading docs.

Added script github-token back in, as well as awaits.

Added a lot of AI suggestions, and skipped some.

AI tells me to use a PAT, Personal Access Token. Maybe if this doesn't work...

I forgot to push, please work now.

Fix the AI bug with an AI fix, because I'm tired.

Testing to move permissions.

Remove user auth debug shizzle.

Add missing envs.

Added issues permission back into reusable script.

Changed to target.

Reverting to using GITHUB_TOKEN.
